    "This package provide functions for InSAR post-processing which refers as processing after SAR images co-registration and geocoding. The functions include PS/DS identification, coherence matrix estimation, phase linking etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the python functions in this package provide 2 kind of API, the array-based API and the file-based API. The inputs of array-based functions generally are numpy or cupy arrays. The inputs of file-based functions are string of path to the array stored in disk. The file-based functions make use of `dask` package to decrease the memory usage and parallelize the job. However, their is performance cost for using `dask`, if no parallelization is needed and the memory fits the data, the array-based API is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLI is also provided and is almost the same as the file-based API. The only difference between them is the CLI can not directly show the plot.\n",

The package is developed with the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), a notebook-driven development platform. Developers only need to simply write notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation, tests, continuous integration, and packaging automatically."
